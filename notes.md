## Initial Ideas
* file structure: html, css, and js file 
* create a div on a page 
* as you scroll keep seeing divs of different colors

* if we have a list of colors and we can just randomly keep changing the color of the di on the page

* notes for next time: infinite scroll or lazy loading
* look up different transition attributes
